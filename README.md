# UX/UI Design

> “Don't make me think.”
>
> - [Steve Krug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Make_Me_Think)

---

Computers run code, developers maintain it, and humans use it. This module focuses on the humans who use it and the developers who maintain it.

You will learn about _Design Thinking_ and _User Empathy_ by designing a home page for one of your classmates that they will develop. The main objective is to understand your classmate and help them to build the home page they need.

Along the way you will explore the world of Open Source Software by selecting a CSS Framework from GitHub, contributing to your classmates home pages, and making a contribution to your CSS Framework's repository.

## Learning Objectives

What you should be learning in this module.

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>
<br>

- You can interview another student to learn their motivations, needs, and blocks
- You can use paper to sketch a design and test it with a user
- You can describe the design cycle and apply it to building a home page for others
- You can write user journeys for websites that you visit
- You can use figma to collaboratively plan a website design

### Research, Definition

- You will be able to describe the design cycle and what steps you will take in each state (Empathize, define, ideate, prototype, testing and implement).
- You will be able to decide when quantitative data is necessary or when qualitative data is necessary, and how to collect both types of data.
- You will be able to conduct some user research to understand user needs, motivations and pain points. Such as user Interview and a user survey.
- You will understand how to interpret quantitative and qualitative data.
- You will be able to use the user research data gathered to define the problem that you need to solve and write a hypothesis on a potential solution.
- You will use rapid prototyping techniques (such as paper prototyping) to test initial design hypotheses and receive user feedback.
- You will use your research findings and initial rapid prototyping to map the user journeys for your websites

### Ideate

- You will learn some of the key design principles, such as alignment, proximity, contrast, balance and space
- You can use Figma to collaboratively plan a website design
- You will learn the basics of using a component library (Atomic design system ?)
- You will be able to understand how to make a website design more accessible.

### Open Source Software

- You will learn what Open Source Software is and why it is important
- You will be able to make a contribution to an Open Source project following their Guidelines and Code of Conduct
- You will be able to evaluate similar Open Source libraries to decide which is best for your project
- You will know how to select an Open Source license for your project

<summary>Open Source Libraries</summary>
<br>

Open Source Libraries are code other people wrote that you can use in your project.

The libraries you will be exploring in this module are CSS Frameworks. These are libraries of CSS classes that you can use in your websites to design and develop more efficiently. You don't need to write the CSS, just use it!

- How to choose a library for your project:
  - [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-choose-between-open-source-libraries-using-popularity-c71677785542/)
  - [open-source.blogspot.com](https://open-source.blogspot.com/)

Now it's your turn. Look through these CSS Framework and pick the best one to use for your home page:

## Week 1

- Practice User Interviews and the Design Thinking Process.
- Take your first steps into the world of Open Source Software.

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>
<br>

### Before Class

- [Design is future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zodT9bCdIiI) - a film that includes main insights about the key role of design while explaining how it helps professionals, businesses and society to be more innovative and sustainable
- [User Experience](https://youtu.be/whtBPzY4K-k) from one of the world leaders of UX Jared Spool. Covers many topics in this hour video interview
- [empathyprompts.net](https://empathyprompts.net/)
- [Design Thinking Process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r0VX-aU_T8)

### During Class

#### Before Break

- _~10 minutes, all together_: Ice breaker! Write a story as a class one sentence a time
  1. Assign numbers to each person, starting with n°1.
  2. Share an issue with the story prompt
  3. One at a time, add your sentences
- _~15 minutes, all together_: What is design? Why is it important?
- _~60 minutes, small groups_: [Draw Toast](https://www.drawtoast.com/)
- _~20 minutes, all together_: each group shares how to make toast

<!--
  Drawing the flow on how to make toast is a good initial exercise - 45 minutes
  You get students to draw out the steps they take to make toast.

  Initially they list out how they like their toast (lightly toasted, with jam on etc),
  they then draw out the steps needed and present this to each other.

  This is good for introducing user needs, pain points, user journey mapping, creating a user flow diagram and presenting.
  Usually people come up with different flows etc, so it’s good for discussions on the need to gather user research and define problems etc.
-->

#### After Break

- _~20 minutes, all together_: User Interviews! Discuss the why's and how's of discovering your user's needs
- _~50 minutes, small groups_: Prepare for this module's project

### After Class

> individual project, 2 weeks

You've come full circle, time to rebuild that home page you started in the Precourse. There will be 3 components to the 2-week project in UX/UI Design:

- **Designing**: Practice User Interviews and Design Thinking by working in pairs to come up with your Home Page backlogs, wireframes and READMEs.
  1. You will each create a repository and fork each other's repositories. (do not add each other as collaborators!)
  2. Push your interview notes to the `/planning` folder in _your fork_ of their Home Page and send them a PR
  3. Help each other turn the interview notes into a Backlog and a complete Wireframe. then you're on your own!
- **Developing**: Practice solo development by turning your backlog into your new Home Page. Learn about open source libraries by choosing and using a CSS Framework in your project.
  1. Complete your Development Strategy
  2. Set up your Project Board & Issues
  3. Develop!
  4. Retrospect
- **Contributing**: Practice contributing to Open Source projects. A contribution can be as simple as fixing a spelling mistake, adding a translation, or participating in an issue's discussion. It's best to make small contributions you are sure will be helpful:
  - Contribute to your classmates' Home Pages. They will not give you access to their repo, so you will need to use a Fork and comment in issues/PRs as an outside collaborator.
  - Make a contribution to your CSS Framework's repository. This doesn't need to be anything fancy, whatever you are comfortable with!
