## 1. First Interview

Take a few minutes getting to know your partner and their ambitions. Ask questions about:

- Their background (Professional, programming, personal)
- Their ambitions (Professional, programming, personal)
- Outside interests (For tying into a personal statement)
- And much more ... listen to your partner and ask questions about what they tell you.

The best way to do your interview is with a lot of `why?`. Start your interview with one or two open-ended questions and follow up with a lot of `why?`, this gives your partner the chance to really explain themselves instead of just answering your questions. You might find that they even learn something about themselves!

### Notes

<!-- Notes you took during the interview. -->

### Summary

<!-- Consolidate your notes into a few sentences. Do your best to express what your partner was trying to say, not what you learned from them. -->
